HTTP/Server/Singlethreaded version 0.01
==================================
A single-threaded HTTP server suitable for building
stand-alone web applications around.

This version is still very early, but the following command
line is able to produce a server on port 8000 that exports
the files in my /tmp directory and provides a clock service:

perl -we 'use HTTP::Server::Singlethreaded \
   static => {"/tmp/" => "/tmp"},\
   function => {"/d/" => sub { \
  "Content-type: text/plain\n\n$_{QUERY_STRING}\n".localtime \
  }};Serve while 1'


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Alternately, just create a HTTP/Server directory under
somwhere in your Perl installation's include path and
copy Singlethreaded.pm there.

You'll want to edit the module some to make it a
little less chatty to STDOUT.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires no modules or libraries not
distributed with core Perl.
